# Description of the project
The project will be the creation of as futuristic style record player. 
The initial plans will be to have a desk with a small half sphere that will project a cone shaped beam upwards.
The record will float in this light over the desk while rotating and swaying.
Music will play while the record in in place.
If that all works as a stretch goal it will be possible to use the oculus controls to pick up the records and swap them out.
Each one having an assigned song or songs to play.
Again time depending the light supporting the record may change colour along with the song.

# Instructions for use
Either auto play or if time allows pick up a reord and drop it into the beam of light.
once there it will start playing.
it can then be grabbed out to stop it and another inserted.

# How it works
curently working on hopes and dreams.
Base and record will be simple primatives. will see about making proves in the records.
Light will be made with unity light effects
rotations and color will be andles by C# code
starting and stopping records will be done by moving them with oculus controlls.

##### Headings

This is code:

```Java
public void render()
{
	ui.noFill();
	ui.stroke(255);
	ui.rect(x, y, width, height);
	ui.textAlign(PApplet.CENTER, PApplet.CENTER);
	ui.text(text, x + width * 0.5f, y + height * 0.5f);
}
```

So is this without specifying the language:

```
public void render()
{
	ui.noFill();
	ui.stroke(255);
	ui.rect(x, y, width, height);
	ui.textAlign(PApplet.CENTER, PApplet.CENTER);
	ui.text(text, x + width * 0.5f, y + height * 0.5f);
}
```
