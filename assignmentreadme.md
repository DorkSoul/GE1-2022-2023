# Description of the project
The project will be the creation of as futuristic style record player. 
The initial plans will be to have a desk with a small half sphere that will project a cone shaped beam upwards.
The record will float in this light over the desk while rotating and swaying.
Music will play while the record in in place.
If that all works as a stretch goal it will be possible to use the oculus controls to pick up the records and swap them out.
Each one having an assigned song or songs to play.
Again time depending the light supporting the record may change colour along with the song.

# Instructions for use
Pick up a reord and drop or throw it into the beam of light.
Once there it will gravitate towards the center and start playing.
It can then be grabbed out to stop it and another inserted.

# How it works
Base and record ar simple primatives.
Light is made of a transparent prinative cylinder and a particle effect.
The records and colors are generated by C# code and each have a song atached to them.
The beam contains most of the C# code. 
It will drap any record towards its center and turn them like a normal record player.
It also begins playing the music assigned to that record.
One this starts playing the the code will get the spectrum data of the sone every second.
This will then be used to change the color of the beam.
The color will lerp between each color and the next over each second moving closer each frame.

# What I am most proud of in the assignment
I am most proud of the color changing with the spectrum. it took a lot of coding and going in wrong directions until i worked it out.
Also very happy with the vr interactions but these were mostly imported from unity.

# What I learned
I learned a lot about the lerp function from trying to get the spectrum data right.
I also learned a lot about the various function unity has built in such as all the particale effect options i had no idea about before.
